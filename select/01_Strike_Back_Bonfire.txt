Livin' day by day - your conscience's far beyond of red alert
Bad turns into good - and justice is not more than just a word

Showtime for the Great Pretender
Selling you his lies
He won't be your soul defender The day - you gonna die

Strike back - set your heart on fire
The devil is a liar
Strike back - raise a smile in heaven
Fighting fire with fire - Strike back
Strike back

Hungry children die - and you go on a diet with champagne
Donations cut your tax - but they don't ease the cryin' mother's pain ain't that insane
Welcome Mr. Satisfaction
Welcome Mr. Greed
He won't give you soul protection
Now - you gotta fight - alright
