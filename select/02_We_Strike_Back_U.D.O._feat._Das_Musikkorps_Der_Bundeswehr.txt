Way too many ears
All around the world
Pray for silence
Sudden loss of data
Identity delete
Crazy science

Spying from the sky
Observing you and I
How much do we have to take

We strike back
Attack the pack
Put them on the run
We strike back
Attack the pack
We are not yet done

They control your life
All around the world
Pray for reason
Terrifying powers
Supremacy elite
Easy treason

Spying from the sky
Observing you and I
How much do we have to take

We strike back
Attack the pack
Put them on the run
We strike back
Attack the pack
We are not yet done

We strike back
Attack the pack
Put them on the run
We strike back
Attack the pack
We are not yet done
We strike back
Attack the pack
Put them on the run
We strike back
Attack the pack
We are not yet done
